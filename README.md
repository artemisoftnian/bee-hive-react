# Bee-Hive

Bee-Hive is an In-Development React Application which serves, as a remote child behavior report and communication tool, between schools and parents.

Imagine this situation for a moment:  

Your phone rings and it's your child's teacher. It says that everything is fine, but they're having behavior problems with your child; Again!; All this time You thought, everything's going fine with my beloved one.  Until you have to go to the school in person. 

Inside you know that, prevention is your best tool to overcome that kind of problem, but the lack of communication, just made your head down.

This Application is that prevention tool you always wanted!  Now you can prevent that behavior before it happens or get worse, because you are now updated on your child's behavior every day and You can act the moment it happens.
